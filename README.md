## Introduction

Acheron MXH is the AcheronProject's library for MX footprint switches using Kailh hotswap sockets (part number CPG151101S11). The footprints were independently developed using the MX switch datasheet.

## How to use

1. Clone the git repository into a ``libraries`` folder inside your KiCad project main folder, also known was ``${KIPRJMOD}``
2. In PCBNEW, go into ``Preferences > Manage Footprint Libraries... `` then under the Project tab, press the plus sign and select the ``acheron_MXH.pretty`` folder.
3. After that the library footprints should be available for addition in the PCB layout from the ``Add a footprint`` button. Click that button or press O and try adding a footprint from the library like the ``MXH100`` footprint.
